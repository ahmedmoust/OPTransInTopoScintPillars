# Optical Photon Transport in Scintillation Pillars with Topographic Surfaces #

This is a proof-of-concept code for modeling optical photon transport in scintillation pillars with side surfaces modeled using their measured 3D topography. It tracks photons throughout the entire volume of a scintillation pillar to the points of collection on photodetectors. At boundary interactions, the code reflects/transmits photons around the local miscroscopic features of the side surfaces. These surfaces are reconstructed from their 3D topography measured using a surface profilometer, like an atomic force microscope. The code is presented in a publication currently under review.

The code methodology is inspired by the DAVIS LUT model[^1] [^2] [^3], which employes pre-computed look-up tables (LUTs) of the angular distributions of reflection and tranmission at a single modeled surface.

## Description
Comprehensive comments are added to the code files and they describe each step. Briefly, the code structure is as follows:
1. Material information are added to the [materials] class.
2. Each optical photon is defined as an instance of the class [opticalPhoton] with its step-wise information (position, momentum, time, etc.).
3. [source] class is used to create instances of source opticalPhoton. Methods for creating sources include: (a) generating optical photons following an external distribution of radiation energy depositions (e.g. from a GEANT4 simulation), (b) reading photons' information from a file, and (c) an isotropic point source of optical photons.
4. [surface] class is used to create an instance of a scintillaltor topographic side surface. The [surfaceExample] provides an example with detailed description of the process.
5. [volume] class is used to create an instance of a geometry volume.
6. [geometry] class is used to create an instance of full geometry. It has methods to check for volume overlaps as well.
7. [tracker] is the essential part of the code as it contains tracking methods. Crucial tests to the tracker are included in [trackerTest].
8. [main] controls the entire code. It consists of three sections:
a. Geometry definition
b. Source definition
c. Tracking control

## Required packages
The code requires the following packages:
- [Open3D], for surface reconstruction from a 3D point cloud.
- [Trimesh], for geometry's volumes setup and ray-tracing.
    - For faster ray tracing, Intel's [Embree] accelerator is required, with its python wrapper [pyEmbree].
    - Last pyEmbree `v0.1.6` is only compatible with Embree `v2.17.7`, which in turn is only compatible with python `v3.6`.
    - pyEmbree fails to install/work on Windows. The code therefore has only been run on UNIX-based systems (see tested OSs below).
    - The pyembree acceleration option is activated _during_ volume creation by Trimesh, i.e. volumes created on systems without a functioning pyembree won't utilize the accelerator when used in on systems that has a functioning installation.
- [h5py], for outputing the tracking history.


The code has been tested with the following:
- 64-bit Intel with Ubuntu 18.04 & 64-bit AMD with CentOS Linux 7
- gcc `7.5.0`
- python `3.6.13`
- ipython `v7.16.1`
- cython `v0.29.23`
- open3d `v0.11.2`
- embree `v2.17.7`
- pyembree `v0.1.6`
- trimesh `v3.9.18`
- h5py `3.1.0`
